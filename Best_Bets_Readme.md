# Project Name\
This project is for Flatiron School Data Science Program (https://flatironschool.com/career-courses/data-science-bootcamp/dc) in Washington DC. This project is the conclusion of Mod 1 which is focused on python and data visualization using libraries such as matplotlib, numpy, pandas and seaborn.
\
#### -- Project Status: [Completed]\
\
## Project Intro/Objective\
The purpose of this project is to analyze movie data for Microsoft. Microsoft is looking to get into the movie business and would like to know what kind of movie is a "safe bet," meaning most likely to earn a significant profit. Movies were analyzed to find the most profitable genres with a high chance of success.
\
### Methods Used\
* Data Cleaning 
* Data Visualization\
* Data Analysis\
\
### Technologies\
* Python\
* Pandas, jupyter\
\
## Project Description\

__Data Sources__
Data Sources include TN Movie Budgets and TMDB Movies, which were provided by Flatiron School. By combining these data sets, 1641 movies were analyzed. These movies were filmed from 1944-2011. The movies were analyzed using the ratio of profit to budget to eliminate the need for inflation calculations. To ensure reliability, genres were cross-checked with imdb.com. 

__Limitations of the analysis include:__
- All box office sales are down since Netflix started movie streaming.
- No data on which movies are most popular for streaming.
- Foreign films were not considered.
- Movies with more than one genre are counted in each genre.
- Director & actor popularity affects profitability and was not considered.
- Release timing was not considered.

__Questions Explored Include:__

What genre should Microsoft make, and what budget should they plan for?
Do big budget movies make a lot of money?
Are any genres safe?
What defines a safe genre?\
